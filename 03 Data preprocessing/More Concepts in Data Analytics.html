<p>We will first review some important concepts in data analytics. Below is an example of a dataset. Let's assume our task is to predict the employee's productivity based on other given information.</p>
<p><img alt="sampledata.PNG" src="/content/enforced2/2100850-CO.430.IT6773.82719.20212/File_0hu3aavuqjth9vq3g91g3ts47vtuzuca001487387249.png" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>- <strong>Dataset</strong>: the collection of data. In this example, the whole data table.</p>
<p>- <strong>Data instance:</strong>&nbsp;one object in the dataset. Also referred to as &lt;b&gt;row&lt;/b&gt; (mostly in 2D data), &lt;b&gt;data point&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;instance&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;record&lt;/b&gt; (in database). In this example, each employee is one instance.</p>
<p>- <strong>Attribute</strong>: one characteristic of the data. Also referred to as &lt;b&gt;column&lt;/b&gt; (mostly in 2D data), &lt;b&gt;variable&lt;/b&gt;. In this example, Employee ID, Name, Salary, Experience... are attributes, or columns.</p>
<p>- <strong>Target</strong>: The column that is the goal of the analysis, usually what we want to predict. In this case, Productivity is the target. Also called <strong>target variable</strong>, <strong>dependent variable</strong>. Recall, we <strong>only</strong>&gt; have a target in supervised learning tasks.</p>
<p>- <strong>Input</strong>, or , <strong>input columns</strong>, or <strong>features</strong>: columns that we give a model to perform the given task that are not the target. Note that not all columns in a dataset are useful for a model. For example, in this case, ID and Name are not useful to predict employee's productivity. However, in analysis where differences among people are emphasize, ID can be a good input.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Numeric column:</strong> columns of which values are meaningful numbers. This means that mathematical operations like adding, subtracting, averaging, etc., yield meaningful results. For examples, <strong>age&nbsp;</strong>is a numeric column, because average age is meaningful.&nbsp;<strong>Team number</strong>, e.g., team 1, team 2... is not a numeric column even though it appears as numeric, because average team number does not mean anything.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Class column</strong>: columns of which values are not numeric. They usually are string values, but in certain cases still look like numbers. The difference from a true numeric column is that math operations/functions applied on numeric columns are meaningful. For example, Salary is a numeric column, mean/average of salary makes sense. If we convert Department to number (e.g. HR = 1, IT = 2, R&amp;D = 3), it is still a class column, because the average of department codes is not meaningful.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Ordinal class</strong>: classes of which values have <strong>inherent order</strong>. These columns can be convert to meaningful numbers. For example, Experience values of Low - Medium - High can be converted to 1 - 2 - 3, because Low &lt; Medium makes sense, and a mean experience of 1.5 suggests more employees are in low and medium experiences.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Nominal class</strong>: classes of which values have no <strong>inherent order</strong>. These columns cannot be convert to meaningful numbers. For example, Department and Branch. HR &gt; IT is meaningless.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Binary class</strong>: classes which have exactly two columns. They are the easiest to deal with. They can be converted to 0 an 1 without worrying about meaning of the numeric values.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- <strong>Distribution</strong>: how values of a column are distributed. In a numeric columns, we may look at the mean, standard deviation, shape of histograms... In a class column, we usually look at the frequency of values.</p>
<p>- <strong>Missing value</strong>: fields in data that have <strong>no meaningful values</strong> compared to other fields in the same column. Note that depend on the data provider, missing values <strong>may or may not</strong>&nbsp;be an empty value in the data. For example, they can be a "<strong>?</strong>" instead of an empty string. Certain companies code their missing value with a number, -1, or 99. We need to refer to the data documentation to make sure about the used format. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
